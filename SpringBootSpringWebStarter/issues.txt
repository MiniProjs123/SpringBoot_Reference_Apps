ISSUES AND NOTES:

- if context cannot be loaded......check qualifier is used and all beans are accounted for in test.

- if getting error: ResourceAccessException: I/O error on GET request for "http://localhost:8080/": Connection refused: connect
  in a @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) test
  .......obviously the port is dynamic in the test, so cannot specify some port such as 8080

- check port not already in use:
  - Windows / git bash
    --> Find processes on 8080:  netstat -vanp tcp | grep 8080
    --> Kill it

  - List all process names with id on Unix
    --> lsof -i 8080

- in order for Serialization of json to work from client payload to server, be sure
  to supply constructor with no arguments!
